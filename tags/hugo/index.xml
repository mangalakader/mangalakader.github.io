      <description>This is a very opinionated blog post describing, why I chose Hugo for my blog. I have no intent on hurting or producing wrong facts about whatsoever, also not trying to praise one over the other.
Started with Jekyll Initially, I just wanted a blog to share my knowledge! I was in the middle of my career and didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to actively write posts. So, I had done some research and stumbled upon GitHub pages for hosting and Jekyll as static site generator.</description>
