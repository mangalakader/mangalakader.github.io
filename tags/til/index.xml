      <description>Recap: In the last part of the series, we saw how to configure the network in host for containers and learnt how to pull images using machinectl. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t gone through that first, please do so.
Before Booting your container for the first time: I&amp;rsquo;m using an cloud based ubuntu image, as it provides cloud-init support, which lets me configure my container during the boot itself. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the details of cloud-init, but I&amp;rsquo;ll give you some idea about minimising full-blown cloud setup.</description>

      <description>Today I Learned Long long time ago, I started using browser bookmarks and the burden of carrying around them system to system has been a pain. I hope, there are people like me, want to carry forward the legacy bookmarks to beyond.
