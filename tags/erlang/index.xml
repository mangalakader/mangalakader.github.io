Elixir is very well known for it&amp;rsquo;s documentation and community involvement and most of the developers, when they adopt elixir, they first struggle to find the help documentation for erlang functions.
We all would have come across this message when using:
iex(1)&amp;gt; h :heart **heart module not compiled with erlang docs So, how do we enable documentation for erlang functions: The solution that I&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss is relevant with ASDF or Kerl.</description></item><item><title>Instant Messaging using erlang and XMPP - Part 1</title><link>https://mangalakader.github.io/post/xmpp-mongooseim-ejabberd-erlang-journey-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mangalakader.github.io/post/xmpp-mongooseim-ejabberd-erlang-journey-part-1/</guid><description>Instant Messaging It&amp;rsquo;s a type of real-time text transmission over the internet and if you want detailed description of what it is please look it up - here Underlying Basics There are couple of things, we need to understand about real-time technologies:
The underlying protocol is not HTTP/HTTPS, but raw TCP with TLS which is equivalent to HTTPS per say also there is a websocket which has been recently gaining popularity in the recent years The afore mentioned protocols heavily rely on keeping the connection to the servers alive until the user forcefully disconnects, whereas the HTTP ones are open and close for every request strategy and not suitable when you want to hit real-time messaging.</description></item><item><title>Elixir - How to solve recompile :noop Issue using VIM</title><link>https://mangalakader.github.io/post/elixir-shell-recompile-noop-issue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mangalakader.github.io/post/elixir-shell-recompile-noop-issue/</guid><description>Many of us are using more advanced editors such as Vim, Visual Studio Code, etc,.

But, I am writing this method particularly to illustrate the pure usage of elixir and joy of learning it! This tutorial is for intermediate users with enough experience in using elixir. I hope you enjoy it!
How can you leverage it? It could be anyone of the following:
a mix task a genserver a function a escript etc.</description></item><item><title>Delete Saved Shell Cmd History in Erlang / Elixir</title><link>https://mangalakader.github.io/post/erlang-elixir-session-shell-cmd-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mangalakader.github.io/post/erlang-elixir-session-shell-cmd-history/</guid><description>To Enable erlang / elixir shell history across sessions: There are lot of tutorials out there illustrating how to enable persistent shell history in erlang / elixir, one such example is found here , so I am not going to elaborate it here.
What if you wanted to delete your shell history: There are not many examples as to how to delete them, once they saved. People have even suggested to disable the shell history and re-enable them, which do not help.</description></item></channel></rss>
