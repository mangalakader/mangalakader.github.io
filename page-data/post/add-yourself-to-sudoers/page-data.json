This tip in a personal pc/system is execellent but when used in systems accessible by others is potentially dangerous and I seriously don't recommend this to be used in such environments! If doing so, resulted in something terrible, I am not responsible! Thank you!</p>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"text-right\">A little Story...</h2>\n<p> Atleast, once in the history of using *nix as OS, we would have come across the situation, where\nwe would have typed a command in shell, and the shell spits out a nasty <b>permission denied</b> error.\nWe immediately, add a <b>sudo</b> and re-execute the same command. Now, shell asks for the user's password.\nFor this, shell we don't have to type the password anymore, but I closed the shell and opened \na new shell, and type <b>sudo {command}</b>, we must type the password to validate my presence again.....</p>\n### Let's see How to stop retyping the password after login:\nThere are two ways of doing it,\n- a risky way of adding things straight to sudoers file\n- or a add a file to a particular folder and it will be picked up by sudoers file\n<p>I will be elaborating just the second way, because this doesn't involve me directly messing with the defaults and I feel it sane, safe &#x26; sound.</p>\n<h3>View the Last Line in the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file:</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\nDefaults    env_reset\nDefaults    mail_badpass\nDefaults    secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin\"\n# Host alias specification\n# User alias specification\n# Cmnd alias specification\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n</code></pre>\n<p>The last line <code>#includedir /etc/sudoers.d</code> is an actual directory which will be included automatically by this file.\nLet's add ourself to sudoers, so we can stop typing password for <code>sudo commands</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a <strong>file with the username</strong> in <code>/etc/sudoers.d</code>, don't forget to use sudo when creating the file.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now add the following to the file: Substitute <code>{username}</code> with your system's username</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">{username} ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Save the file and do a restart for the sudo service or do a full system restart, if that doesn't help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, if you open a shell and type sudo commands, you will not be prompted for passwords.</p>\n<p><b>Note: Be careful, because we are messing with sudo services, this might potentially be dangerous.</b></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Add yourself to Sudoers - No {re-}typing password!","date":"08 August, 2018","tags":["linux","unix"]},"excerpt":"I will be elaborating just the second way, because this doesn't involve me directly messing with the defaults and I feel it sane, safeâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/add-yourself-to-sudoers/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/erlang-elixir-session-shell-cmd-history/"},"frontmatter":{"published":true}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/download-binaries-using-httpoison-elixir-the-correct-way/"},"frontmatter":{"published":true}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
